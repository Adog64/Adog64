### Feel free to browse!
- I like to put most of my personal projects on here
- Most of what's here is done in my spare time for fun
- For Mac/Windows users, some of my code may not work for you since I do a lot of my work from ZorinOS

### Check out Lotus Mobile!
- A Rubik's Cube timer for android
- Lotus Mobile is my most fleshed-out project to date

### Language Knowledge
- My favorite is Python (by far)
- I know my way around C#, Java, Visual Basic, and C++
